These forces become significant in micromechanical systems at submi- crometre scales, such as in the adhesion between movable parts. The Casimir force, through a close connection to classical pho- tonics, can depend strongly on the shapes and compositions of the objects, stimulating a decades-long search for geometries in which the force behaves very differently from the monotonic attractive force first predicted by Casimir. Recent theoretical and experimental developments have led to a new understanding of the force in complex microstructured geometries, includ- ing through recent theoretical predictions of Casimir repulsion between vacuum-separated metals, the stable suspension of objects and unusual non-additive and temperature effects, as well as experimental observations of repulsion in fluids, non- additive forces in nanotrench surfaces and the influence of new material choices.},

A transition from a disordered isotropic phase at low coverage to a highly ordered phase with a coverage-dependent lattice constant at higher coverage is found and attributed to a repulsive intermolecular force. To deduce the origin of this repulsion a model is set up, containing the Coulomb interaction between molecules and between localized dipoles from the push-back effect, as well as the intermolecular van der Waals potential. The modeling of the van der Waals interaction is done on a force field level. We find that the observed repulsion can only be explained when assuming a certain screening of the attractive London forces by the presence of the metal substrate.},

abstract = {The molecular organization of a polar phthalocyanine, titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc), on the Ag(110) surface was studied with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). in addition to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions that guide structure for nonpolar Pc's, we find evidence for the impact of dipole interactions on layer organization for TiOPc/Ag(110). TiOPc molecules adsorb on Ag(110) with a tilted orientation that contrasts with the flat-lying orientation typically observed for nonpolar phthalocyanines. At the highest TiOPc coverages, the layer consists of neighboring TiOPc molecules with opposing molecular tilts. Close inspection reveals a higher level organization, consisting of "zigzag" TiOPc molecular chains with molecular spacings along the chain that are smaller than the average within the layer. We suggest an explanation for this behavior based on the dipole-dipole interactions within the chain. At reduced coverage, variable densities of molecular vacancies form, depending on the coverage. The vacancies align to form rows that order into well-organized superstructures. Finally, TiOPc surface structures on Ag(110) are compared and contrasted with those on Ag(111). The different adlayer arrangements on these two surfaces created by molecule-molecule interactions and molecule-substrate interactions lead to a change from a "ferroelectric" orientation for the TiOPc molecular tilts (and in-plane dipole components) on Ag(111) to an "antiferroelectric" arrangement on Ag(110). We show that this change agrees with theoretical predictions of the influence of lattice symmetry on dipole lattice arrangements, providing additional evidence for the impact of dipole-dipole interactions on the TiOPc surface layer organization.},

abstract = {The understanding of the fundamental physical properties of metal-organic and organic-organic interfaces is crucial for improving the performance of organic electronic devices. This is particularly true for (multilayer) systems containing several molecular species due to their relevance for donor-acceptor systems. A prototypical heteromolecular bilayer system is copper-II-phthalocyanine (CuPc) on 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetra-carboxylic- dianhydride (PTCDA) on Ag(111). In an earlier work we have reported a commensurate registry between both organic layers and an enhanced charge transfer from the Ag substrate into the organic bilayer film [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 106103 (2012)], which both indicate an unexpectedly strong intermolecular interaction across the organic-organic interface. Here we present new details regarding electronic and geometric structure for the same system. In particular, we provide evidence that the enhanced charge transfer from the substrate into the organic bilayer does not involve CuPc electronic states, hence, there is no significant charge transfer into the second organic layer. Furthermore, we report vertical bonding distances revealing a shortening of the PTCDA-Ag(111) distance upon CuPc adsorption. Thus, electronic and geometric properties (charge transfer and bonding distance, respectively) both indicate a strengthening of the PTCDA-Ag(111) bond upon CuPc adsorption.We explain these findings‚Äîin particular the correlation between CuPc adsorption and increased charge transfer into PTCDA‚Äîin a model involving an intermolecular screening mechanism.},

The results are compared with the fundamental lateral structures known from experiment and an excellent agreement was found for these weakly interacting systems. Furthermore, the calculations are even suitable for chemisorptive adsorption as demonstrated for copper-phthalocyanine/Cu(111), if the influence of charge transfer between substrate and molecules is known and the corresponding charge redistribution in the molecules can be estimated.

Unstable configurations in which the force between the objects is repulsive are constructed. Such configurations exist for three anisotropic atoms as well as for an anisotropic atom above a dielectric plate with a hole whose permittivity is anisotropic. Apart from the absolute magnitude of the force, the dependence on the configuration is qualitatively the same as for metallic objects for which the anisotropy is a purely geometric effect. In the weak limit, closed analytic expressions for rather complicated configurations are obtained. The nonmonotonic dependence of the interaction energy on separation is related to the fact that the electromagnetic Green's dyadic is not positive definite. The analysis in the weak limit is found to also semiquantitatively explain the dependence of Casimir forces on the orientation of anisotropic dielectrics observed experimentally. Contrary to the scalar case, irreducible electromagnetic three-body energies can change sign. We trace this to the fact that the electromagnetic Green's dyadic is not positive definite.},

As NC-DMC satisfies detailed balance, a phase space can be defined that permits both an exact trajectory weighting and a fast mean-field trajectory weighting technique to be constructed which can eliminate or reduce the population bias, respectively. The second is a many-body diagrammatic expansion for trial wave functions in systems dominated by strong on-site harmonic coupling and a dense matrix of bilinear coupling constants such as the QDO in the dipole limit; an approximate trial function is introduced to treat two-body interactions outside the dipole limit. Using these approaches, high accuracy is achieved in studies of the fcc-solid phase of the highly polarizable atom, xenon, within the QDO model. It is found that 200 walkers suffice to generate converged results for systems as large as 500 atoms. The quality of QDO predictions compared to experiment and the ability to generate these predictions efficiently demonstrate the feasibility of employing the QDO approach to model long-range forces.},

Specifically, we study the behaviour of van der Waals interactions in single-layer and multilayer graphene, fullerenes of varying size, single-wall carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons. As a function of nanostructure size, the van der Waals coefficients follow unusual trends for all of the considered systems, and deviate significantly from the conventionally employed pairwise-additive picture.

abstract = {Treating both many-body polarization and dispersion interactions is now recognized as a key element in achieving the level of atomistic modeling required to reveal novel physics in complex systems. The quantum Drude oscillator (QDO), a Gaussian-based, coarse grained electronic structure model, captures both many-body polarization and dispersion and has linear scale computational complexity with system size, hence it is a leading candidate next-generation simulation method. Here, we investigate the extent to which the QDO treatment reproduces the desired long-range atomic and molecular properties. We present closed form expressions for leading order polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients and derive invariant (parameter-free) scaling relationships among multipole polarizability and many-body dispersion coefficients that arise due to the Gaussian nature of the model. We show that these ‚Äúcombining rules‚Äù hold to within a few percent for noble gas atoms, alkali metals, and simple (first-row hydride) molecules such as water; this is consistent with the surprising success that models with underlying Gaussian statistics often exhibit in physics. We present a diagrammatic Jastrow-type perturbation theory tailored to the QDO model that serves to illustrate the rich types of responses that the QDO approach engenders. QDO models for neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, designed to reproduce gas phase properties, are constructed and their condensed phase properties explored via linear scale diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. Good agreement with experimental data for structure, cohesive energy, and bulk modulus is found, demonstrating a degree of transferability that cannot be achieved using current empirical models or fully ab initio descriptions.},

abstract = {Presented is a polarizable force field based on a classical Drude oscillator framework, currently implemented in the programs CHARMM and NAMD, for modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of peptides and proteins. Building upon parameters for model compounds representative of the functional groups in proteins, the development of the force field focused on the optimization of the parameters for the polypeptide backbone and the connectivity between the backbone and side chains. Optimization of the backbone electrostatic parameters targeted quantum mechanical conformational energies, interactions with water, molecular dipole moments and polarizabilities and experimental condensed phase data for short polypeptides such as (Ala)5. Additional optimization of the backbone $\phi$, $\psi$ conformational preferences included adjustments of the tabulated two-dimensional spline function through the CMAP term. Validation of the model included simulations of a collection of peptides and proteins. This 1(st) generation polarizable model is shown to maintain the folded state of the studied systems on the 100 ns timescale in explicit solvent MD simulations. The Drude model typically yields larger RMS differences as compared to the additive CHARMM36 force field (C36) and shows additional flexibility as compared to the additive model. Comparison with NMR chemical shift data shows a small degradation of the polarizable model with respect to the additive, though the level of agreement may be considered satisfactory, while for residues shown to have significantly underestimated S(2) order parameters in the additive model, improvements are calculated with the polarizable model. Analysis of dipole moments associated with the peptide backbone and tryptophan side chains show the Drude model to have significantly larger values than those present in C36, with the dipole moments of the peptide backbone enhanced to a greater extent in sheets versus helices and the dipoles of individual moieties observed to undergo significant variations during the MD simulations. Although there are still some limitations, the presented model, termed Drude-2013, is anticipated to yield a molecular picture of peptide and protein structure and function that will be of increased physical validity and internal consistency in a computationally accessible fashion.},

abstract = {Conspectus The understanding of adsorption and reactions of (large) organic molecules at metal surfaces plays an increasingly important role in modern surface science and technology. Such hybrid inorganic/organic systems (HIOS) are relevant for many applications in catalysis, light-emitting diodes, single-molecule junctions, molecular sensors and switches, and photovoltaics. Obviously, the predictive modeling and understanding of the structure and stability of such hybrid systems is an essential prerequisite for tuning their electronic properties and functions. At present, density-functional theory (DFT) is the most promising approach to study the structure, stability, and electronic properties of complex systems, because it can be applied to both molecules and solids comprising thousands of atoms. However, state-of-the-art approximations to DFT do not provide a consistent and reliable description for HIOS, which is largely due to two issues: (i) the self-interaction of the electrons with themselves arising from the Hartree term of the total energy that is not fully compensated in approximate exchange-correlation functionals, and (ii) the lack of long-range part of the ubiquitous van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The self-interaction errors sometimes lead to incorrect description of charge transfer and electronic level alignment in HIOS, although for molecules adsorbed on metals these effects will often cancel out in total energy differences. Regarding vdW interactions, several promising vdW-inclusive DFT-based methods have been recently demonstrated to yield remarkable accuracy for intermolecular interactions in the gas phase. However, the majority of these approaches neglect the nonlocal collective electron response in the vdW energy tail, an effect that is particularly strong in condensed phases and at interfaces between different materials. Here we show that the recently developed DFT+vdW(surf) method that accurately accounts for the collective electronic response effects enables reliable modeling of structure and stability for a broad class of organic molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces. This method was demonstrated to achieve quantitative accuracy for aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and diindenoperylene), C60, and sulfur/oxygen-containing molecules (thiophene, NTCDA, and PTCDA) on close-packed and stepped metal surfaces, leading to an overall accuracy of 0.1 {\AA} in adsorption heights and 0.1 eV in binding energies with respect to state-of-the-art experiments. An unexpected finding is that vdW interactions contribute more to the binding of strongly bound molecules on transition-metal surfaces than for molecules physisorbed on coinage metals. The accurate inclusion of vdW interactions also significantly improves tilting angles and adsorption heights for all the studied molecules, and can qualitatively change the potential-energy surface for adsorbed molecules with flexible functional groups. Activation barriers for molecular switches and reaction precursors are modified as well.},

    abstract = {An accurate determination of the electron correlation energy is an essential prerequisite for describing the structure, stability, and function in a wide variety of systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approaches for the calculation of the correlation energy (and hence the dispersion energy as well) is essential and such methods can be coupled with many density-functional approximations, local methods for the electron correlation energy, and even interatomic force fields. In this work, we build upon the previously developed many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures. Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.},

Not surprisingly, vdW self-consistency leads to tiny modifications of the structure, stability, and electronic properties of molecular dimers and crystals. However, unexpectedly large effects were found in the binding energies, distances, and electrostatic moments of highly polarizable alkali-metal dimers. Most importantly, vdW interactions induced complex and sizable electronic charge redistribution in the vicinity of metallic surfaces and at organic-metal interfaces. As a result, a substantial influence on the computed work functions was found, revealing a nontrivial connection between electrostatics and long-range electron correlation effects.},

It exhibits a uniquely rich phenomenology including dramatic variations in behavior over the wide temperature range of the liquid into water's crystalline phases and amorphous states. We show that many-body responses arising from water's electronic structure are essential mechanisms harnessed by the molecule to encode for the distinguishing features of its condensed states. We treat the complete set of these many-body responses nonperturbatively within a coarse-grained electronic structure derived exclusively from single-molecule properties. Such a "strong coupling" approach generates interaction terms of all symmetries to all orders, thereby enabling unique transferability to diverse local environments such as those encountered along the coexistence curve. The symmetries of local motifs that can potentially emerge are not known a priori. Consequently, electronic responses unfiltered by artificial truncation are then required to embody the terms that tip the balance to the correct set of structures. Therefore, our fully responsive molecular model produces, a simple, accurate, and intuitive picture of water's complexity and its molecular origin, predicting water's signature physical properties from ice, through liquid-vapor coexistence, to the critical point.},

Measurements of fluid flow in nanotubes, with diameters ranging from 0.6 to 100 nm dramatically raised interest in them, with very high water flow rates promising to deliver orders-of-magnitude higher performance compared to other membranes. This promise was based on reports of flow enhancement, defined as a ratio of the measured flow compared to a no-slip Poiseuille flow, ranging from 10 to 100,000 with the underlying assumption that commercial membranes would exhibit the no-slip behavior. The concept of flow enhancement, though, is of little help for actual filtration applications where one is interested in a membrane◊≥s performance in terms of selectivity and permeability. In this work, the flow enhancement and permeability of \{UF\} carbon nanotube‚Äìanodic alumina membranes (CNT‚ÄìAAM) with a large range of diameters is reported. Using a recently developed model, it is shown that the permeability is directly related to the solid‚Äìliquid molecular interactions between the liquid and the nanotubes. Finally, the performance of these \{CNT\} membranes and others in the literature has been analyzed in terms of permeability, comparing them to commercial membranes in the RO, \{NF\} and \{UF\} ranges. Results show that in fact, carbon nanotube membranes have a higher pure water permeability than commercial polymer membranes. "

Pressures of 1.2{$[$}plusmn{$]$}0.3{$[$}thinsp{$]$}GPa are found using Raman spectrometry for molecular layers of 1-nm in thickness. We further show that this pressure can induce chemical reactions, and several trapped salts are found to react with water at room temperature, leading to two-dimensional crystals of the corresponding oxides.

abstract = {This work reviews the increasing evidence that many-body van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions play a crucial role in the structure, stability and function of a wide variety of systems in biology, chemistry and physics. Starting with the exact expression for the electron correlation energy provided by the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we derive both pairwise and many-body interatomic methods for computing the long-range dispersion energy by considering a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators within the random-phase approximation. By coupling this approach to density functional theory, the resulting many-body dispersion (MBD) method provides an accurate and efficient scheme for computing the frequency-dependent polarizability and many-body vdW energy in molecules and materials with a finite electronic gap. A select collection of applications are presented that ascertain the fundamental importance of these non-bonded interactions across the spectrum of intermolecular (the S22 and S66 benchmark databases), intramolecular (conformational energies of alanine tetrapeptide) and supramolecular (binding energy of the 'buckyball catcher') complexes, as well as molecular crystals (cohesive energies in oligoacenes). These applications demonstrate that electrodynamic response screening and beyond-pairwise many-body vdW interactions-both captured at the MBD level of theory-play a quantitative, and sometimes even qualitative, role in describing the properties considered herein. This work is then concluded with an in-depth discussion of the challenges that remain in the future development of reliable (accurate and efficient) methods for treating many-body vdW interactions in complex materials and provides a roadmap for navigating many of the research avenues that are yet to be explored.},
