\begin{abstract}
Long-range van der Waals dispersion interactions in large complex systems remain fundamentally difficult to predict accurately, as evidenced by a number of recent experiments. Missing contributions to van der Waals dispersion from the commonly used dipole-approximation stand in the way of understanding experimental phenomena and predicting intermolecular interactions at large. Establishing higher-order interaction terms by going beyond the dipole-approximation with a many-body basis, we unravel missing physical interactions that are especially relevant in larger systems and under confinement. We focus on the coupling between dispersion and polarization in the long-range and demonstrate the resulting role of Coulomb singles in a selection of representative large complexes including supramolecular host-guest systems and carbon nanotubes. In doing so, we establish how long-range repulsive interactions manifest in confined systems and reveal the considerable impact of Coulomb singles in larger complexes. %needs a sentence to summarize general implications for broader interest.    

%Long-range repulsive contributions to the interactions between confined molecules have been evidenced by a number of experiments and recently also demonstrated theoretically. 
%This physical repulsive interaction has been missing from van der Waals (vdW) approximations in density functional theory (DFT) methods to date. Given the tendency of vdW-inclusive methods in DFT to overbind confined systems, the inclusion of the first-order full Coulomb interaction to the many-body dispersion (MBD) method is expected to alleviate overbinding. We develop an approach to include this term in the MBD formalism, such that the well-established S66 benchmark data set is computed with an accuracy of xx kJ/mol. This method is then applied to supramolecular confined systems such as the prototypical buckyball--catcher and also buckyball--ring systems. We find that the effect of the long-range repulsive interaction is significant in the confined systems and should be included to make accurate and physically coherent predictions.

%%\section{Introduction}

\section*{Introduction}
Long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions between atoms and molecules, though typically characterized as ``weak'', underpin a great deal of physical and chemical behavior in biological and material science. %The intricacies of 
%Quantum-mechanical electron density fluctuations give rise to dispersion interactions, but due to their many-body nature they remain a considerable challenge to predict.
%Physically, vdW interactions form the major part of long-range electron correlation and arise from instantaneous quantum-mechanical fluctuations in the electron density. As such, they are inherently many-body in nature, which renders their accurate description a considerable challenge.
The vdW dispersion interaction is a major part of electron correlation and arises from the quantum mechanical fluctuations in electron densities. Most approaches for predicting vdW interactions are based on an additive pairwise framework that only considers the interaction between pairs of charge densities and yields the well-established $1/r^6$ interaction, with $r$ being the interatomic distance, and the corresponding system-dependent $C_6$ dispersion coefficient. However, considering electron-electron interactions in a complete framework, $<\Psi |1/r| \Psi>$, it is evident that a simple pairwise framework neglects two salient aspects of electron correlation: (i) its many-body nature and (ii) response or self-consistency of the interaction, given by higher-order terms.  Therefore, more slowly-decaying terms than $1/r^6$ arise which tend to increase in importance in larger systems. Some higher-order terms, corresponding to dispersion coefficients such as $C_8$ and $C_{10}$, are known and can be computed presently, but still based on the dipole-approximation (\textit{i.e.} pairwise) and thus neglects the many-body nature of dispersion interactions. In addition, there are further higher-order terms which have still to be established and understood in the context of materials and biological systems. 

% Experiments show that simulations are still a long way from providing definitive explanations to observed phenomena.
Indeed, the vast majority of computational studies to date are not able to fully account for many-body dispersion interactions. It is typically envisaged that a dipole-coupled approximation to the dispersion interaction is sufficient to accurately predict properties of interest, such as binding energies and geometries. However, this notion is increasingly disputed as the missing physics in the most widely used computational methods continues to stand in the way of understanding \textit{state-of-the-art} experimental phenomena. For example, the experiments of Pollice \textit{et al.} reveal the considerable impact of the solvent on the intra- and intermolecular dispersion interactions in proton-bound dimers\cite{Pollice2017}, whilst their computational study using implicit solvents in combination with dipole-approximation based methods fail to capture the effect. In another notable experiment, Secchi \textit{et al.} found that water flows ultra-fast through narrow carbon nanotubes (CNT), but not through boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT)~\cite{secchi2016massive}. In this regard, theorists are still working towards satisfactory modeling of this effect and capturing the underlying physical interactions~\cite{Michaelides2016,Kannam2013,Striolo2016,Mattia2015266}. In a similar vein, the spatial separation and ordering of large polarizable molecules on metal surfaces~\cite{Wagner2010,Thussing2016}, salient in organic thin films for organic electronics, highlights gaps in common modelling approaches. For instance, Wagner~\textit{et al.} showed that large aromatic molecules organize into highly ordered arrays at high coverage on Au(111)~\cite{Wagner2010}. Interestingly, the authors rationalize their findings using repulsive, Coulombic intermolecular interactions, induced by screening from the metal. % chktex 36

Our work here elaborates on the physical interactions that are indicated in the aforementioned experiments using a fundamental theoretical basis, which we use to predict a selection of representative large complexes. We use a many-body basis and focus on the coupling between dispersion and polarization. In doing so, we go beyond the dipole-approximation for higher-order terms and arrive at Coulomb singles â€“ a dispersion-polarization coupling interaction, which we will show to be particularly impactful in large systems, such as supramolecules and carbon nanotubes.   

%The experimental examples of Secchi~\textit{et al.} and Wagner~\textit{et al.} are confined systems. Confinement in general is prevalent, \textit{e.g.}\ a molecule adsorbed on a surface is quasi-3D confined; a molecule between two sheets is quasi-2D confined; and a molecule in a narrow nanotube is quasi-1D confined. Dispersion interactions play a key role in confined systems, but are challenging to compute with accurate quantum mechanical methods due to the typical size and complexity of confined systems. The complexity of confined systems, in particular, calls for a complete description of Coulombic interactions between fluctuating electron densities, to fully account for all dynamic correlation. However, this is practically an insurmountable task for anything beyond a few atoms. One effective method of predicting larger systems is to use a perturbative approach to go beyond the dipole-coupled approximation. As we describe hereafter, by accounting for higher multipoles in a perturbative approach, we better approximate the quantum behavior of fluctuating charge densities.

\end{figure}

VdW dispersion interactions originate from the long-range electron correlation energy.
Therefore, they depends only on the fluctuations in the electron charge density, more specifically only on correlations in those fluctuations that occur on length scales exceeding intra-atomic distances.
Taking advantage of this fact, the many-body dispersion (MBD) method models vdW interactions by approximating a given electronic system (its charge fluctuations) with a set of effective charged harmonic (Drude) oscillators, with each oscillator corresponding to a single atom, mimicking its long-range electrodynamic response, and mutually interacting with other oscillators via the dipole potential, $T_\mathbf{pp}$,
\begin{equation}
\hat H_\text{MBD}=\hat T+\hat U+\hat T_\mathbf{pp}
\end{equation}
where $\hat T$ and $\hat U$ are the kinetic energy operator and harmonic potential operator, respectively.
This Hamiltonian lends itself to a closed-form solution in the form of coupled oscillator modes, and the vdW energy is obtained as the difference in the ground-state energy between this interacting system and its noninteracting variant ($\hat T_\mathbf{pp}=0$), with the corresponding ground states $|\Psi_1\rangle$ and $|\Psi_0\rangle$, respectively,
\begin{equation}
E_\text{MBD}=E_1-E_0=\sum_k\frac{\omega_{1,k}}2-\sum_k\frac{\omega_{0,k}}2
\end{equation}
where $\omega_k$ is the energy of the $k$-th coupled oscillator mode.

In this work, we improve upon the dipole approximation in $\hat H_\text{MBD}$ by deriving and evaluating the Coulomb correction, $\hat V-\hat T_\mathbf{pp}$, to the MBD energy in the first order of the perturbation theory,
\begin{equation}
E_\text{MBD}^{(1)}=\langle\Psi_1|\hat V-\hat T_\mathbf{pp}|\Psi_1\rangle-\langle\Psi_0|\hat V-\hat T_\mathbf{pp}|\Psi_0\rangle
\end{equation}
Following the division of the electronic Coulomb energy into its classical and correlation parts in electronic structure theory, we likewise divide the Coulomb energy of the correlated ground-state wave function of the Drude oscillators into its classical part, $J[\rho]$, and the correlation part, $E_\text{corr}[\Psi]$.
Since $\langle\Psi_0|\hat T_\mathbf{pp}|\Psi_0\rangle=0$ and $E_\text{corr}[\Psi_0]=0$, the first-order Coulomb correction can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
E_\text{MBD}^{(1)}=\bigl(J[\rho_1]-J[\rho_0]\bigr)+\bigl(E_\text{corr}[\Psi_1]-\langle\Psi_1|\hat T_\mathbf{pp}|\Psi_1\rangle\bigr)
\end{equation}
Here, the first term is the change in the electrostatic energy of the oscillators caused by the polarization of the system induced by vdW dispersion interactions, and the second term is a Coulomb correction to the dipole correlation energy.
To first order in $\Delta\rho=\rho_1-\rho_0$, the first term can be expressed as $J[\rho_0,\Delta\rho]$---the electrostatic interaction energy of the noninteracting density of the oscillators with the density polarization induced by the dispersion.

We note that in the presence of a polarizable environment, the first-order correction to the MBD energy between two bodies can decay asymptotically slower than the zeroth-order MBD energy. The dipole correlation in the MBD ground-state wave function between a \emph{finite} body and its environment induces permanent quadrupole moments on the oscillators, whose electrostatic interaction then decays as $R^{-5}$.
In contrast, the MBD interaction energy between the two bodies in such a system (including the environment) decays asymptotically as $R^{-6}$.

\subsection*{Coulomb corrections for small molecular dimers}
We begin by applying the first-order perturbation term to the S66 molecular data set of small, unconfined and non-covalently interacting dimers~\cite{s66X8_database}. A consistent approach is developed here to incorporate Coulomb singles in the MBD approach, which we refer to as MBD+CS, and is constructed by analyzing the first-order perturbation theory (PT) correction for small molecular dimers.
%(Fig.~\ref{fig:s66}).
For such systems, semi-local or hybrid density functional approximations in conjunction with the MBD formalism are designed to provide excellent agreement with accurate reference results from the coupled cluster calculations with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T))~\cite{Tkatchenko2012}.  % chktex  36
%, shown in red dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:s66}(A).
The S66 dimers are
%close approximations to 
non-covalently interacting dimers in 3D isotropic vacuum and in accordance with Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic} we expect minuscule first-order Coulomb corrections in this case.
%Fig.~\ref{fig:s66}(A) indeed shows that
Indeed, we find that the Coulomb singles contributions for all systems in S66 are very small and they can have both positive as well as negative values (see the Supplementary Material for more information). As a result, the accuracy of PBE+MBD with and without Coulomb singles is equally good for the interaction energies of S66 dimers. %As a result, the addition of Coulomb singles barely affects PBE+MBD binding energies for small organic dimers.

\section*{Results}
For the following results, we use MBD+CS to compute binding energies of supramolecular host--guest complexes and confined Xe atoms in capped CNTs. These larger confined systems reveal the impact of Coulomb singles on binding energies, as well as the length scale and character of the repulsive long-range interactions.

%In the next sections we use MBD+CS to compute supramolecular host--guest complexes and confined Xe atoms in CNTs. In doing so, the accuracy of MBD+CS is assessed with respect to experimental and wavefunction-based reference information. Furthermore, we establish the length scale and character of the long-range repulsive interaction that manifests between CNT confined Xe atoms.
%A general discussion and summary will be given and finally, the theoretical basis of the Coulomb singles and how it is combined with the MBD approach is given. There also, the computational methods are presented along with details of the molecular systems computed.

\subsection*{Coulomb corrections for host--guest complexes}

Host--guest molecular systems are significantly more complex than the S66 dimers, but are still tractable with accurate benchmark methods such as the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). Here, we first ascertain the impact of Coulomb singles on the interaction energies of host--guest complexes and demonstrate the accuracy of PBE0+MBD+CS with respect to DQMC reference interaction energies from previous works. In addition, a connection might be expected between geometric factors (\textit{e.g.} asymmetry and steric effects) and the magnitude of Coulomb singles contributions. To this end, we analyze this possible connection in geometrically similar host--guest complexes and arrive at important insights into the quantum mechanical nature of $E_{\rm CS}$.

\subsection*{Interaction energies of two host-guest complexes and the role of Coulomb singles}

The accurate prediction of interaction energies for non-covalently bound materials is an ongoing challenge for researchers and workhorse DFT methods are at the forefront of development efforts. The complex balance of intermolecular interactions is particularly challenging to predict and what is more, the target accuracy is generally in the range of a few kJ/mol in interaction energies. Our approach to better accuracy is to improve the physical basis of theoretical methods---here, by incorporating the Coulomb singles contributions.
Fig.~\ref{fig:flagshipsystems} shows two select examples of host--guest complexes. For both systems, the guest molecule is a C$_{70}$-fullerene (buckyball) while the host is either [6]-cycloparaphenyleneacetylene (6-CPPA, Fig.~\ref{fig:flagshipsystems} left) or the ``catcher'' molecule (Fig.~\ref{fig:flagshipsystems} right)~\cite{s12l_2013}. In the framework of Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}, the host molecule serves as both confinement and the interaction partner. The 6-CPPA and catcher molecules provide a different confining environment for the buckyball by virtue of their geometry. We therefore focus on these systems to showcase the contribution of Coulomb singles in confined systems.

\end{figure*}

Within the dipole approximation, it has already been shown that many-body effects play an important role for the description of binding energies in such host--guest complexes~\cite{hermann_ncomm2017}. Here, we show that also beyond-dipole interactions, in the form of Coulomb singles, have a significant effect, and that inclusion of Coulomb singles to PBE0+MBD yields an excellent agreement with the reference results from DQMC\@. The Coulomb singles contribution for C$_{70}$ in 6-CPPA and in the buckyball-catcher is 6.4~kJ/mol and 4.9~kJ/mol, respectively. Considering our findings for the S66 data set above, this clearly highlights the importance of Coulomb singles corrections %under confinement, \textit{i.e.}
once the 3D isotropy of vacuum is substantially perturbed. 

The relative contribution of Coulomb singles to the total binding energy for C$_{70}$ in 6-CPPA and in the buckyball-catcher is 6.2\% and 3.9\%, respectively.
%% MSt: added the following sentence to rule out the most obvious idea right from the beginning
As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:flagshipsystems} (and more obviously from Fig.~\ref{fig:rings}), the Coulomb singles contribution does not correlate with the system size nor the vdW interaction within dipole-coupling.
However, the different $\rm E_{CS}$ contributions can be interpreted in terms of the physics described in the dipole-coupled state, which represents the starting point (unperturbed state) for the calculation of the Coulomb singles contribution by means of PT\@.
One important factor is how the dipolar coupling changes the density of electronic fluctuations (\textit{i.e.} $\delta\rho$ shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}), which can be obtained as the expectation value of the charge density operator via the MBD wave function, $\Psi_{\rm MBD}$ (see below), of the dipole-coupled and non-interacting set of quantum harmonic oscillators (QHOs).
Looking at the host--guest interaction, we analyze the difference of $\delta\rho$ with respect to the isolated monomers.
This gives us a measure of how much the density deforms upon the host--guest interaction and, therefore, forms a connection between confinement and electronic fluctuations and polarizability.
The density difference shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flagshipsystems} %, where red regions indicate a decrease and blue regions an increase in the density.
%As can be seen from this depiction,
shows that, upon dipole-coupling, the density of electronic fluctuations for C$_{70}$ in 6-CPPA is more trongly deformed into the plane of 6-CPPA\@.
Furthermore, we find that the overall displaced charge, \textit{i.e.} the integral over the density difference, can serve as a descriptor for the Coulomb singles contribution to the interaction energy:
With increasing displaced charge, we observe an increased Coulomb singles contribution to the interaction energy. We point out that this also applies to all the other systems considered below.
Hence, the electronic properties obtained for the dipole-coupled state can serve as a qualitative \emph{rule-of-thumb} to estimate the magnitude of the Coulomb singles energy.
% \textcolor{red}{\textbf{later: also explain this in terms of field lines of Coulomb singles as in Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}. (should be easily accessible in current framework of calculating CS...)}}

\subsubsection*{Asymmetry and steric effects in host--guest complexes}

Naturally, one might quantify confinement in terms of the (molecular) geometry. Among other measures, the asymmetry of the system and the proximity of the atoms or subsystems represent common descriptors. To explore such connections between $E_{\rm CS}$ and geometric features, we additionally analyze a class of geometrically similar ring--C$_{70}$ complexes depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:rings}: The four complexes are C$_{70}$ hosted by four different conformations of 8-CPPA\@.
 %and the last one is a second configuration of C$_{70}$ in 6-CPPA with the fullerene being situated partly outside the host (dubbed ``tilted conformation'' in Ref.~\cite{hermann_ncomm2017}). 
In previous work, PBE0+MBD has been shown to provide reasonably accurate binding energies with respect to DQMC~\cite{hermann_ncomm2017}. As can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:rings}, the addition of the Coulomb singles contribution to PBE0+MBD improves the binding energies of all four complexes further. Despite the molecular similarities however, the individual Coulomb singles contributions vary significantly across these systems ($\rm E_{CS}$ shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:analysis_rings}b). The displaced charge with respect to isolated monomers, introduced above as a measure of the confinement of the electronic response, indicates here the general trend of the Coulomb singles energy also. This corroborates the connection between electronic confinement and the Coulomb singles contribution.

\begin{figure*}[htp]

(B) Measure of axial-radial asymmetry ($f_a$), proximity measure ($f_d$), and \emph{Coulomb singles} contribution to binding energy (all values normalized to results for R4).}\label{fig:analysis_rings}
\end{figure*}

%In order toleometrical measures:
In order to understand the role of asymmetry and steric effects on Coulomb singles, we consider some possible geometrical measures:
One for proximity ($f_d$), which is given by the sum of inverse distances between the atoms of the fullerene guest molecule and the CPPA-host, and one for the asymmetry of the system ($f_a$).
For the latter, we first define an axis along the elongated direction of C$_{70}$ and then span a plane along that axis, perpendicular to the CPPA-ring, labeled as P$_v$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:analysis_rings}A.
The four phenyl units closest to this plane are considered as ``axial'' and the remaining four as ``radial''.
Based on this classification, we define ``axial vicinity'' ($A_{\parallel}$) and ``radial vicinity'' ($A_{\perp}$) by summing the inverse distances between all fullerene atoms and atoms of the corresponding ``axial'' and ``radial'' phenyl rings, respectively.
Our measure of (axial-radial) asymmetry is then given by $f_a = (A_{\parallel} - A_{\perp})/(A_{\parallel} + A_{\perp})$. Fig.~\ref{fig:analysis_rings}B summarizes the results for the proximity and asymmetry measures and the Coulomb singles energy.
It is clear that in principle, proximity plays a certain role for electronic confinement (\textit{cf.}\ proximity and Coulomb singles contributions for C$_{70}$ in 6-CPPA and R1). As can be seen from our more detailed analysis in Fig.~\ref{fig:analysis_rings}, however, purely geometric considerations do not suffice to capture the trends in $E_{\rm CS}$. First, the proximity measure, $f_d$, is insensitive to the relevant changes and remains almost constant among all studied systems, whereas the Coulomb singles contribution varies significantly.
Furthermore, the asymmetry measure, $f_a$, turns out to have no correlation with $E_{\rm CS}$ (see R3 versus R4 in Fig.~\ref{fig:analysis_rings}).
Thus, also a pairwise description of asymmetry between atomic positions is insufficient to predict the qualitative trend of the contribution of CS\@.
The failure to capture the behaviour of $E_{\rm CS}$ in terms of simple geometric characteristics stems from the fact that the Coulomb singles contribution is a quantum-mechanical effect arising from beyond-dipole interactions of electronic fluctuations, which show a far-from-trivial dependence on the geometrical features of a system.

\subsection*{Impact of Coulomb singles in capped carbon nanotubes}

}\label{fig:CNT}
\end{figure*}
Having established the importance of $E_{\rm CS}$ for confined host--guest systems, we now employ our methodology to investigate the effects of confinement for Xe dimer inside carbon nanotubes (CNT). We will be investigating how the confinement changes the relative importance of Coulomb corrections on dipole coupled vdW interactions. Xe does not posses a permanent multipole and has a considerably large polarizability. As a result, the Xe--Xe interaction is purely vdW.
%carbon nanotube's structure and its connection to polarizability
%Carbon nanotubes, in principle, can be created by folding a 2D graphene sheet.
%Depending on the way of folding,

CNTs can be distinguished by their chiral vector $\mathbf{R}=m \mathbf{a}_1 +n \mathbf{a}_2 $.
%Here $\mathbf{a}_1$ and $\mathbf{a}_2$ are unit cell vectors for 2D graphene sheet. Therefore, the atomic arrangement of CNTs, and hence their electronic properties, are dependent on the integer pair $m$ and $n$.
Armchair CNTs with $m=n$ are metallic in nature by virtue of their delocalized electronic states. Since, the Coulomb singles contribution becomes significant in the presence of metallic screening\cite{sadhukhan_prl_2017}, we analyze the Xe--Xe binding energy inside two armchair, hydrogen-capped, CNTs with $m = n = 5$ and $m = n = 6$. The diameters of $5\times5$ and $6\times6$ CNTs are 6.78 \AA\ and 81.3 \AA, respectively. The length of these nanotubes is 30 \AA, which is long enough to avoid significant edge-effects and to serve as a model for a periodic CNT\@. The binding energies of Xe dimer inside a nanotube is calculated as $E_{Xe-Xe} = E_{Xe_2+CNT}+E_{CNT} - 2 E_{Xe+CNT}$, where $E_{Xe_2+CNT}$, $E_{Xe+CNT}$ and $E_{CNT}$ are the energies of Xe dimer hosted by a CNT, one Xe atom hosted by a CNT, and a bare CNT, respectively.

%desription of results of Xe dimer inside CNTs
Fig.~\ref{fig:CNT} summarizes the effect of the confining potential of capped CNT on the Xe dimer binding energy. We focus on the variation of dipole-coupled MBD and corresponding Coulomb singles contributions as a function of the inter-Xe distance $R_{Xe-Xe}$. Fig.~\ref{fig:CNT}A demonstrates these energy components for capped CNTs of both diameters. Note that $E_{\rm MBD}$ for both capped CNTs converge to an asymptotic value while $E_{\rm CS}$ does not. Clearly, $E_{\rm CS}$ is much more sensitive to the confining effects of capped CNT compared to the $E_{\rm MBD}$. In 3D isotropic vacuum, Xe dimer equilibrium distance and binding energy are 4.36~\AA\ and 2.35~kJ/mol, respectively\cite{Jerabek_2017}. The much smaller magnitude of Xe--Xe interaction energies inside the capped CNTs demonstrates a strong destabilizing effect on the Xe dimer binding energy as a result of the confining CNT\@. As expected, the Xe dimer inside the $6\times6$ capped CNT is less affected by the vicinity of the CNT wall and is more stabilized. Similarly, the Coulomb singles interaction increases with narrower CNT\@. Evidently, the Coulomb singles contribution decays at much longer interatomic distance compared to the MBD energy. The power-law fitting of these two energies (see SI) show that the MBD interaction energy can be fitted reasonably with $R_{Xe-Xe}^{-6}$ and $R_{Xe-Xe}^{-12}$. However, one needs significantly larger number of power-law terms to fit $E_{\rm CS}$. This is indicative of the longer-range nature of $E_{\rm CS}$. These results, therefore, support our previous prediction regarding the length-scale of CS\cite{sadhukhan_prl_2017, sadhukhan_prl_reply2018}.

%balance of attraction and repulsion
%As evident from the divergent trend of the ratios for these two nanotubes, the $E_{\rm CS}$ contribution overrides long-range attraction more drastically for narrower nanotube.
Fig.~\ref{fig:CNT}B explicitly shows the cumulative vdW binding energy $E_{vdW} = E_{CS} + E_{MBD}$. For nanotubes, the $E_{vdW}$ indeed becomes repulsive at a distance. We see that the threshold distance at which the total vdW interaction changes its qualitative nature is a function of nanotube radius. Further studies will be needed to shed light on the exact functional relation between them.
We explore the effect of confining effect of CNT more for $6\times 6$ CNT in Fig.~\ref{fig:CNT}C. We compare the $E_{MBD}$ and $E_{CS}$ for confined Xe dimer with the corresponding energies for unconfined Xe dimers. We can clearly see here that for both $E_{MBD}$ as well as $E_{CS}$, we get less attractive interactions. This can happen due to combined fluctuation modes of Xe dimer and CNT are delocalized enough to reduce the attractive interactions between negative and positive Drude particles. However, the additivity of interaction energy assumed here to compute the Xe dimer binding energy inside CNT can also affect the results quantitatively. Future studies will be targeted to understand the mechanism of repulsion in greater details.    

To explore the balance between repulsive $E_{\rm CS}$ and attractive $E_{\rm MBD}$ more clearly we show the ratio of their absolute values as a function of $R_{Xe-Xe}$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:CNT}D. We see clearly that for both CNT diameters, the ratio increases with $R_{Xe-Xe}$ and crosses 1.0, which signifies that the $E_{\rm CS}$ eventually supersedes $E_{\rm MBD}$. Therefore, in longer range $E_{\rm CS}$ becomes the dominant contribution. This is remarkable considering the previous \textit{status quo} that in the long-range, the vdW interaction is always attractive. This is the first time we see that the longer range vdW interaction is actually repulsive under confinement. 


\textbf{The above section will most likely undergo a few changes, once the overall structure of the article is agreed on. As an alternative, hopefully more insightful, approach we will reformulate it according to the following ideas:
\begin{itemize}
    \item evaluate the ``Xe--Xe interaction'' (not well defined within CNT) as relative energies with respect to the ``dissociation limit'', \textit{i.e.} the maximum Xe--Xe distance we can achieve without significant edge effects.
    \item Fig. 5 will contain
    \item[(1)] full (relative) PBE+MBD and PBE+MBD+CS energetics for Xe$_2$ in (6,6)-CNT as well as in gas-phase from equilibrium distance to ``dissociation limit'' including a zoom-in into the ``repulsive'' region of PBE+MBD+CS\@. This shows the relevance of confinement and the qualitative changes Coulomb singles can introduce.
    \item[(2)] (relative) MBD, CS, and MBD+CS energies for Xe--Xe in (5,5)- and (6,6)-CNT to show the effect of the CNT radius on the balance of MBD and CS\@.
    \item The discussion in the text will be adapted accordingly plus a (very) short comparison to Ar$_2$ in CNT and Xe$_2$ in zig-zag CNT to briefly show the effect of the polarizability of the confined dimer and the confinement.

%effect of electronic structure (specific example:water)
%The following gives the impression that the previous study is highly disputed
%Having proved our previous analytical prediction's correctness regarding long-range vdW repulsion through atomistic modelling, 
Having demonstrated our previous analytical predictions regarding long-range repulsion through atomistic modelling, we now note that the effects and magnitude of this repulsion will vary depending on several factors. As an example, we will consider the flow rate of water inside CNT and BNNT\@. In this example, for Coulomb singles to have a considerable impact, the polarizabilities of the confined molecular fragments have to be large enough to allow significant long-range repulsion. Indeed, a molecular cluster of polarizable molecules (\textit{e.g.} water clusters) have a large polarizability~\cite{hammond_2009} for sustaining an impactful $E_{\rm CS}$. As a result, we expect that there is a stronger long-range vdW repulsion between water clusters than between single water molecules. Second, when molecular fragments are strongly bonded to the inner wall of a nanotube (\textit{i.e.} strong hydrophilic interaction in the case of water), the repulsive vdW interaction can turn out to be inadequate to accelerate the molecule through the nanotube. Comparison of water binding energies on graphene and hexagonal boron nitride sheets show that the water sticks to the latter substrate significantly more (DQMC binding energy = 9.17 $\pm$ 0.48 kJ/mol) compared to graphene (DQMC binding energy = 6.75 $\pm$ 0.96 kJ/mol)\cite{Al-Hamdani_CNT_2017, Al-Hamdani_BNNT_2017}. Therefore, the water percolation through CNT is expected to be more favourable compared to BNNT\@. Indeed, that is the exact outcome observed in the experiments\cite{secchi2016massive}. Furthermore, due to difference in electronegativity of B and N atoms in BNNT the height of potential energy barriers for water molecule movement are expected to be larger and uneven compared to CNT\@. As a result, the vdW repulsion has to overcome these energy barriers in order to have an accelerating impact on water flowing through nanotubes. Therefore, the exact dynamics of water molecules inside nanotubes will be a delicate balance of all the aforementioned factors.\\

%connection to other methods
The Coulomb singles contributions are demonstrated in our study of large confined systems and the quantum mechanical nature of this interaction has been elucidated as a result. It is important to note here that $E_{\rm CS}$ can be formally connected to other electronic structure theory methods. While exact proofs of such connections will require further research, from conceptual understanding we can consider some possibilities. First, given the resemblance between $E_{\rm CS}$ and the interaction between singly excited states in post Hartree--Fock theories, we may find that the singles amplitudes in coupled-cluster theories are the source of $E_{\rm CS}$ under confinement~\cite{connect_CC} (\textbf{Ask Max for permission?, iirc Science journals do not allow personal communication as Ref.}). It is also worth noting here that the singles excitation operator from configuration interaction methods contains both doubles and singles excitation operator from coupled-cluster methods ($C_1 = T_2 + \frac{1}{2}{(T_1)}^2$, where $T_1$, $T_2$ and $C_1$ denote the coupled-cluster single, double and configuration interaction single excitation operators, respectively). A similar connection can also be expected between $E_{\rm CS}$ and select coupled-cluster singles diagrams, modulated by confinement. However, the random phase approximation (RPA) misses all singles corrections and as a result, a traditional RPA methodology is not expected to account for this interaction. As shown in our previous work~\cite{sadhukhan_prl_2017}, conventional density functional theory (DFT) approximations also do not predict this interaction. This is expected since most of the exchange-correlation functionals used in DFT are  based on the uniform electron gas and subsequently parameterized to predict small, unconfined molecules. As a result, these functionals lack a proper description of quadrupole polarizabilities and therefore  $E_{\rm CS}$. Common \textit{a posteriori} dispersion models, including those beyond dipole-dipole interactions such as Grimme's D3~\cite{grimme_2010} or the XDM approach~\cite{becke_2006,angyan_2007,ayers_2009,heselmann_2009} do not account for $E_{\rm CS}$ at present.

There are two main reasons $E_{\rm CS}$ has not been described before. First, experimental accuracy and precision has not been sufficient previously, to reveal the unusual behaviour arising from $E_{\rm CS}$ in the microscopic length scale. As an example, the advancements of nanofluidic techniques and the ability to manufacture nanotubes with desired properties have helped unearth the phenomenon of accelerated water flow through carbon nanotubes. Also, the prohibitively large computational cost for \textit{ab initio} quantum mechanical study of these large systems barred the possibility of its theoretical prediction. Second, the prevalent conception about the universality of long-range attraction between polarizable electronic moieties has also contributed overlooking such components. However, with the advancement of experimental and theoretical methodologies has recently set the stage for such findings.

In summary, we developed a unified methodology to incorporate a previously neglected, part of full Coulomb interaction between instantaneous electronic fluctuations. We show that the inclusion of this contribution to vdW interaction becomes significant for relatively larger molecular systems and can even change the qualitative nature of intermolecular interactions. The negligible computational cost of the present methodology compared to benchmark electronic structure calculations provides significant motivation to explore large systems for which such benchmark methods are expensive to compute. Particularly, for interacting systems inside CNT confinements, we find the effect of this correction becomes dominant in the inter-atomic distances, far larger than the Xe--Xe equilibrium distance. Also we show that this interaction is decidedly dependent on the many-body nature of coupled electronic fluctuations and hence cannot captured by pair-wise schemes. It is important to mention here that while the first-order Coulomb correction over dipole-coupled energy is expected to be modulated by higher order perturbation corrections, their cumulative effects will be smaller in the long-range, as evident from their distance-dependence\cite{sadhukhan_prl_2017}. As a result, even after inclusion of higher-order perturbative corrections, the qualitative picture presented here is expected to remain.

%What can happen in future:outlook
It will be imperative in future, however, to advance this methodology by means of better benchmark results for large systems and the inclusion of even higher-order perturbation corrections. Other major applications of this methodology will include the explanations and possible predictions of molecular adsorption of polarizable molecules on metal surfaces. Furthermore, the inter-molecular interactions and consequent structural changes inside 2D materials will be a useful testing ground for such interactions.\\

%\section*{Methods}
The MBD formalism approximates the electronic fluctuations as coupled, atom-centred dipoles, each with a natural width. The Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mbd_ham}
\begin{split}
\hat{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{MBD}} = &\overbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{3N} \left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \xi_{k}^2} + \frac{1}{2}\omega_k^2  \xi_k^2\right) }^{\hat{\mathcal{H}}_0}\\
& \qquad + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k,l}^{3N} \omega_k\omega_l\sqrt{\alpha_k \alpha_l}\,\xi_k \mathbf{T}_{kl}^{\rm LR} \xi_l \quad,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
describes such a system of $N$ 3D quantum harmonic oscillators (QHOs) coupled by dipole potential. The solution eq.~\eqref{eq:mbd_ham} is obtained by direct diagonalization to obtain the eigenvectors $\mathbf{C}$ and eigenvalues $\mathbf{\Lambda} = \mathrm{diag}\{\tilde{\omega}_i^2\}$. The MBD energy is defined as the (zero-point) interaction energy with respect to non-interacting QHOs:
 \begin{eqnarray}
 E_{\rm MBD}
=\frac{\hbar}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{3N}\tilde{\omega}_i - \frac{3\hbar}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_i \quad . \label{eq:mbd_en}
 \end{eqnarray}
 In accordance with this definition, the first-order correction to $E_{\rm MBD}$ towards full Coulomb interaction in the proposed formalism is as well defined in reference to the set non-interacting of oscillators. This is done by means of (first-order) perturbation theory and thus the Coulomb singles contribution is then obtained according to
 \begin{equation}\label{foc_energy_damp}
E_{\rm CS} = \Braket{\Psi_{\rm MBD} | V^\prime | \Psi_{\rm MBD}} - \Braket{\Psi_0 | V^\prime | \Psi_0} \:,
\end{equation}
where $\Psi_{\rm MBD}$ is the wave function of the dipole-coupled state, as obtained from the eigenvector matrices $\mathbf{C}$ (for further details, see Ref.~\cite{hermann_ncomm2017}), and $\Psi_0$ is the wave function of the corresponding non-interacting set of QHOs described by $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_0$ in eq.~\eqref{eq:mbd_ham}. The perturbing potential, $V^\prime$ is given by the (damped) beyond-dipole potential, \textit{i.e.} the sum over $f(\bar{Z}_{AB})\left(V_{AB}^{\rm Coul}-V_{AB}^{\rm dip}\right)$ for all pairs of QHOs $A$ and $B$ with $f(\bar{Z}_{AB})$ as damping function. The new damping function thereby follows the same functional form as in MBD with new parameters $a=10.12$ and $\beta=1.4$.

All DFT calculations have been carried out within FHI-aims~\cite{fhi_aims}. For the calculations employing the PBE0 hybrid functional, results at the default \emph{really tight} level of settings have been extrapolated based on PBE0 with \emph{tight} settings and results obtained with the PBE-GGA functional with \emph{tight} and \emph{really tight} settings. While significantly reducing computational costs, this scheme has been proven to provide an excellent estimate for PBE0 at the \emph{really tight} level~\cite{Hoja2018}. We, thus, refer to it as PBE0. The same extrapolation scheme was used to account for the effect of the corresponding change in Hirshfeld volumes, which form the basis for all MBD and Coulomb singles calculations. All reported results using the PBE \textit{xc}-functional have been obtained at the \emph{tight} level of settings in FHI-Aims.
